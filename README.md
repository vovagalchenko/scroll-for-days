Infinite Scroll
========
iOS library for displaying views in a scrollable infinite wall. You can write your own delegate for the infinite scroll view and provide the views to be displayed. The framework includes a bunch of code so you can easily provide images from the internet to be downloaded and displayed in the infinite wall. For an example of how to use the framework refer to the InfiniteScrollSample project, which displays Flickr images in the infinite scroll view.
